# Aztec Network Sequencer Node
A step by step guide on How to Run `Sequencer Node` on Aztec Network Testnet & Earn `Apprentice` Role.

* **What types of nodes can participate in the testnet?**
  * `Sequencer`: proposes blocks, validates blocks from others, and votes on upgrades.
  * `Prover`: generates ZK proofs that attest to roll-up integrity.

## Roles Info
Sequecner Nodes will receive a certain role for their contribution on Discord.

# Install Aztec Network Sequencer Node using One line Command Code

1. **Setup RPC and Faucet for Aztec Node**
   - Before running an Aztec node, make sure you have access to the Sepolia Ethereum RPC, Sepolia Beacon RPC, and testnet funds from the Sepolia Ethereum Faucet.
   - **Ethereum Sepolia RPC**: Use a provider like Alchemy, Infura, or a Sepolia public node. Example endpoint: `https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_API_KEY` (replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your API key).
   - **Sepolia Beacon RPC**: Use the Beacon Chain endpoint for Sepolia, such as from a node service provider. Example: `https://drpc.org/chainlist/eth-beacon-chain#eth-beacon-chain-sepolia`.
   - **Sepolia Ethereum Faucet**: Get testnet ETH for Sepolia from official faucets, such as:
     - [Google Cloud Sepolia Faucet](https://cloud.google.com/application/web3/faucet/ethereum/sepolia)
     - Make sure you have a wallet that supports Sepolia to receive testnet funds.

2. **Run Aztec Node**
   - Run an Aztec node on your server using the following one-click script:
     ```bash
     wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicomunasatya/Aztec-Node/main/Aztec.sh && chmod +x Aztec.sh && ./Aztec.sh
     ```
   - Make sure you have configured your node with the Ethereum Sepolia RPC and Sepolia Beacon RPC set up.
   - Once the node is running, wait about 15 minutes for the node to sync and be ready to use.

3. **Check Block Number and Proof**
   - Once the node is finished syncing, check the **block number** and **proof** required for the verification process.
   - Open the Aztec node installation menu (usually available in the terminal or node interface after the script is run).
   - Look for an option or command in the installation menu to display the **block number** (the most recent block number from your node) and **proof** (the proof data generated by the node).
   - Note this information carefully, as it will be requested by the Discord bot later.

4. **Enter Aztec Discord Server**
   - Join the Aztec Discord Server via the following link: [Aztec Discord](https://discord.gg/aztec).
   - After getting the block number and proof, log into the Aztec Discord server and navigate to the `operators | start-here` channel.

5. **Use Commands to Get Started**
   - Inside the `start-here` channel, type the following command to start the process of getting the Apprentice role:
     ```
     /operator start
     ```
   - After the command is executed, the bot will ask for some information.

6. **Enter Required Data**
   - The bot will ask for some information, such as:
     - **Address** (Your wallet address used on the Sepolia network)
     - **Block Number** (The block number of your Aztec node, which you have noted down)
     - **Proof** (Evidence or required data, which you have obtained from the installation menu)
   - Enter each data one by one as requested by the bot.

7. **Get Apprentice Role**
   - Once all the information is entered correctly, you will immediately get the **Apprentice** role on the Aztec Discord server.

## Tips
- Make sure your node is running and properly connected to the Ethereum Sepolia RPC and Sepolia Beacon RPC before attempting to obtain a role.
- Check the block number and proof carefully in the installation menu to ensure the data you entered into the Discord bot is accurate.
- Don't worry if the bot doesn't respond immediately, it's normal during the sync process.
- Make sure you have permission to run the script (`chmod +x`) and a stable internet connection when running the one-click script.
- Keep your RPC and wallet credentials safe, and make sure you have enough testnet ETH from the faucet for node operations.

## Aztec update for latest node version
1. Reinstall
```
./Aztec.sh
```
2. Check peer id
```
sudo docker logs $(docker ps -q --filter ancestor=aztecprotocol/aztec:alpha-testnet | head -n 1) 2>&1 | grep -i "peerId" | grep -o '"peerId":"[^"]*"' | cut -d'"' -f4 | head -n 1
```
3. Paste peer
https://aztec.nethermind.io/

With the steps above, you can now get the **Apprentice** role on Discord Aztec after waiting for some time and providing the required data!

---

## 3. Update Aztec
```bash
aztec-up alpha-testnet
```

---

## 4. Obtain RPC URLs
* Find a 3rd party that supports Sepolia `RPC URL` & Sepolia `BEACON URL` APIs.
* Most of your usage is `RPC URL`. I recommend to use [Alchemy](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/) for `RPC URL` & Use [drpc](https://drpc.org/) for `Beacon URL`.
  
**More details on RPC solutions**:

### Get Your Own RPC by Running Geth & Prysm Nodes
* You can run your own local RPC nodes by following this guide: [geth-prysm-node](https://github.com/0xmoei/geth-prysm-node). You may need 600-1000 GB SSD
  
### Free:
* `RPC URL`: Create a Sepolia Ethereum HTTP API in [Alchemy](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/)
* `BEACON RPC`: Create an account on [drpc](https://drpc.org/) and search for `Sepolia Ethereum Beacon Chain ` Endpoints.

---

## 9. Run Sequencer Node
You can run Sequencer Node through one of these two methods: `Docker` or `CLI`

### Method 1: Run via Docker (Recommended)
* Delete CLI Node
```bash
# Stop docker containers
docker stop $(docker ps -q --filter "ancestor=aztecprotocol/aztec") && docker rm $(docker ps -a -q --filter "ancestor=aztecprotocol/aztec")

# Stop screens
screen -ls | grep -i aztec | awk '{print $1}' | xargs -I {} screen -X -S {} quit
```

* Create `aztec` directory:
```bash
mkdir aztec
```

* Get into `aztec` directory:
```bash
cd aztec
```
 
* Create `.env`
```bash
nano .env
```

* Replace the following code in `.env`
```env
ETHEREUM_RPC_URL=RPC_URL
CONSENSUS_BEACON_URL=BEACON_URL
VALIDATOR_PRIVATE_KEY=0xYourPrivateKey
COINBASE=0xYourAddress
P2P_IP=P2P_IP
```
* Replace the following variables before you Run Node:
  * `RPC_URL` & `BEACON_URL`: Step 4
  * `0xYourPrivateKey`: Your EVM wallet private key starting with `0x...`
  * `0xYourAddress`: Your EVM wallet public address starting with `0x...`
  * `P2P_IP`: Your server IP (Step 7)


* Create `docker-compose.yml`:
```bash
nano docker-compose.yml
```

* Replace the following code in `docker-compose.yml`
```yml
services:
  aztec-node:
    container_name: aztec-sequencer
    network_mode: host 
    image: aztecprotocol/aztec:alpha-testnet
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      ETHEREUM_HOSTS: ${ETHEREUM_RPC_URL}
      L1_CONSENSUS_HOST_URLS: ${CONSENSUS_BEACON_URL}
      DATA_DIRECTORY: /data
      VALIDATOR_PRIVATE_KEY: ${VALIDATOR_PRIVATE_KEY}
      COINBASE: ${COINBASE}
      P2P_IP: ${P2P_IP}
      LOG_LEVEL: debug
    entrypoint: >
      sh -c 'node --no-warnings /usr/src/yarn-project/aztec/dest/bin/index.js start --network alpha-testnet --node --archiver --sequencer'
    ports:
      - 40400:40400/tcp
      - 40400:40400/udp
      - 8080:8080
    volumes:
      - /root/.aztec/alpha-testnet/data/:/data
```
Note: My node data directory configued in `docker-compose.yml` is `/root/.aztec/alpha-testnet/data/`, yours can be anything.

* Run Node Docker:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

* Node Logs:
 ```bash
docker compose logs -fn 1000
```

* Optional: Stop and Kill Node
```bash
docker compose down -v
```
* Done, you can now head to Step 10.


### Method 2: Run via CLI
* Open screen
```bash
screen -S aztec
```

* Run Node
```
aztec start --node --archiver --sequencer \
  --network alpha-testnet \
  --l1-rpc-urls RPC_URL  \
  --l1-consensus-host-urls BEACON_URL \
  --sequencer.validatorPrivateKey 0xYourPrivateKey \
  --sequencer.coinbase 0xYourAddress \
  --p2p.p2pIp IP
  --p2p.maxTxPoolSize 1000000000
```
Replace the following variables before you Run Node:
* `RPC_URL` & `BEACON_URL`: Step 4
* `0xYourPrivateKey`: Your EVM wallet private key starting with `0x...`
* `0xYourAddress`: Your EVM wallet public address starting with `0x...`
* `IP`: Your server IP (Step 7)

### Optional Commands:
**Screen Commands:**
* Minimze screen: `Ctrl` + `A` + `D`
* Return to screen: `screen -r aztec`
* Kill screen (when inside): `Ctrl`+`C+
* Kill screen (when outside): `screen -XS aztec quit`

---

## 10. Sync Node
After entering the command, your node starts running, It takes a few minutes for your node to get synced.

* Check the latest synced block number of your sequencer:
```
curl -s -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"node_getL2Tips","params":[],"id":67}' \
http://localhost:8080 | jq -r ".result.proven.number"
```
* Check the latest block number of Aztec network: https://aztecscan.xyz/

---

## 11. Register Validator
Make sure your Sequencer node is fully synced, before you proceed with Validator registration
```bash
aztec add-l1-validator \
  --l1-rpc-urls RPC_URL \
  --private-key your-private-key \
  --attester your-validator-address \
  --proposer-eoa your-validator-address \
  --staking-asset-handler 0xF739D03e98e23A7B65940848aBA8921fF3bAc4b2 \
  --l1-chain-id 11155111
```
Replace `RPC_URL`, `your-validator-address` & 2x `your-validator-address`, then proceed

* Note: There's a daily quota of 5 validators registration per day, if you get error, try again tommorrow.
* If your Validator's Registration was successfull, you can check its stats on [Aztec Scan](https://aztecscan.xyz/validators)

---

## 12. Verify Node's Peer ID:
**Find your Node's Peer ID:**
```bash
sudo docker logs $(docker ps -q --filter ancestor=aztecprotocol/aztec:alpha-testnet | head -n 1) 2>&1 | grep -i "peerId" | grep -o '"peerId":"[^"]*"' | cut -d'"' -f4 | head -n 1
```
* This reveals your Node's Peer ID, Now search it on [Nethermind Explorer](https://aztec.nethermind.io/)
* Note: It might takes some hours for your node to show up in Nethermind Explorer after it fully synced.

**Step 1: Get the latest proven block number:**
```bash
curl -s -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"node_getL2Tips","params":[],"id":67}' \
http://localhost:8080 | jq -r ".result.proven.number"
```
* Save this block number for the next steps
* Example output: 20905

**Step 2: Generate your sync proof**
```bash
curl -s -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"node_getArchiveSiblingPath","params":["BLOCK_NUMBER","BLOCK_NUMBER"],"id":67}' \
http://localhost:8080 | jq -r ".result"
```
* Replace 2x `BLOCK_NUMBER` with your number

**Step 3: Register with Discord**
* Type the following command in this Discord server: `/operator start`
* After typing the command, Discord will display option fields that look like this:
* `address`:            Your validator address (Ethereum Address)
* `block-number`:      Block number for verification (Block number from Step 1)
* `proof`:             Your sync proof (base64 string from Step 2)

Then you'll get your `Apprentice` Role
